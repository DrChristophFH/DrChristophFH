# Hey there! 🌱

I'm Christoph from Tirol (the fancy mountain place ⛰️), Austria, and I'm currently studying for my master's degree in Software Engineering in Hagenberg, Upper Austria.

I'm a curious coder with a soft spot for **algorithms** and **data structures**, the magical stuff that first got me hooked on programming. While I still enjoy unraveling problems with a good ol' stack or tree, my career compass is currently pointed toward **Software Architecture**, a space I find endlessly fascinating.

## 🧠 What I'm Into

🛠 **Architecture & Systems Thinking**
From **distributed tracing** to **event-driven microservices**, I love diving into the mechanics of large-scale systems. It's like a never-ending puzzle of interconnected moving parts, and I live for it.

📚 **Perfectionism (Managed Edition)**
Yes, I can be a perfectionist. No, it doesn't stop me anymore. I've learned to balance craft with pragmatism, and that's been a journey all by itself.

👓 **Bachelor Thesis Throwback**
I once went deep into the Java debugging internals (JDPA & JDI) and built a **custom visual debugger** using **DearImGUI** and Java bindings. It was equal parts pain and pleasure, definitely a formative experience!

## 💼 Currently @ [SCCH](https://www.scch.at)

At SCCH, I'm working on software solutions that use **LLMs** (Large Language Models) and **VLMs** (Vision-Language Models) to solve problems that were previously out of reach.

Some of the cool stuff I'm involved in:

* 🧠 Hybrid **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
* 🔍 **Static code analysis** powered by AI
* 🤖 Building intelligent assistants for niche, complex domains

## 🗺 Let's Connect!

Feel free to explore, fork, star, or just drop by and say hi.
I'm always open to a good tech chat, especially if it involves systems design 😄
